Chess Game
----------

My project to **67452 FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING: HASKELL** course at **Hebrew University of Jerusalem**

This will work only on Linux, but I may add support in the future for Windows as well.

To run the game just enter ghci and:
::
  Preload> :load Chess.hs
  Preload> main

You'll understand how to play while playing.

Have FUN!!
